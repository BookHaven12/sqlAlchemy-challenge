# Climate Data Analysis and API Development

## Overview
 In this project I used SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas and Matplotlib to perform a basic climate analysis for a vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. Then I created a Flask API based on the queries performed in part 1. This project is broken into 2 parts:

## Part 1: Climate Data Analysis and Visualization
* Queried and analyzed precipitation trends for the past 12 months
* Identified the most active weather stations based on observation counts
* Cacluated temperature statistics (min, max, avg) for the most active station
* Visualized data using bar charts and histograms in Maplotlib

## Part 2: Flask and API Development
* Built a landing page  with SQLite conneciton
* Created static routes to return precipitation, station names, and temperature date in JSON format
* Added dynamic routes to return temperature statistics for specified dates and ranges

### Skills Demonstrated: 
* SQLAlchemy ORM Queries
* Pandas 
* Data Visualization using Matplotlib
* Flask API Development


### Resources:
I was able to write the majority of this code from using the following homework examples:
* Adv SQL Day 3- Dates_solution, Dow_dates_solution, and Ins_Flask_with_ORM
* I used Chatgpt to help fix errors with my code when needed
